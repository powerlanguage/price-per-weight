# Price-per-weight converter

In the grocery store, I often want to compare the price by weight of items.  However, this number is often listed at different scales (typically pounds vs ounces) for different products.

This app allows you to quickly compare the value of two products. You can see it here: http://powerlanguage.co.uk/converter/

I built this using `create-react-app` to see what the advantages were.
